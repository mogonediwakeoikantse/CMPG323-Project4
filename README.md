# CMPG323-Project4
Repository for project 4

### Welcome to CMPG323 Project 4 Repository. 
#### This project is based on UIPath implementation whereby functionalities are created on UiPath orchestrator. These functionalities basically implement CRUD operations on a web application. 

#### Brief
The project contains different workflows and an excel document. Uipath reads data of the excel document and prints the data on the web application. 
The first workflow is "TestZones"
The second workflow is "TestCategories"
The third workflow is "TestDevices" 

### How does it work?
The functions in UIPATH operate to read data from the excel document, and the data gets stored in a datatable on UIPATh. The data is the transferred to the web application through a series of different functions. Once the data is on the web app, UIPath runs more functions to test whether the data has been successfully created and read on the web appplication. 

##### Requirements:
###### * UIPath Automation
###### * GIT
###### * Github
###### * Browser(preferably Chrome)
